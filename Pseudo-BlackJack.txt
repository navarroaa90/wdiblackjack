   // The game is to have a total of 21 or close to 21 in the players hand with out going over.
   // player must choose to either 'hit' (take another card) or 'stand' (stop taking cards) until they either hit 21 or bust.

   // Actions 
    // dealing card from the deck
     //adding card to player's hand
    // enable player to hit
    // enable player to stand
    // begin and end rounds
    // shuffling the deck
    

    //player is given 2 cards
    //dealer dealt 1 card face up and 1 card face down
    //dealer or player > 21 = busted
   // if both player and dealer have an ACE, if paired with 4 it will have a value of 1 (soft 15)
   // If reciveing a value that will bust with an ACE card it will be a hard hand (anything above 10)

   // if Players first 2 cards has a total of 17-21 on the first two cards , enable stand
   // if players first 2 cards has a total of 2-16 enable hit

   // after the dealers turn we compare hands

     //whoever is closer to 21 wins
    // if both values are equal between the dealer and player its a PUSH
    // if both the player and dealer have 21, also a PUSH
